## Background

- Assistant professor of urban design and analytics
- Coordinator of Spatial Data & GIS education
- Co-founder of the [Rbanism community](https://rbanism.org)
- Author of the geospatial R packages [`rcrisp`](https://cityriverspaces.github.io/rcrisp/), [`rcoins`](https://cityriverspaces.github.io/rcoins/), and [`visor`](https://cityriverspaces.github.io/visor/)

## Motivation

::: {.incremental}

* Conducting urban morphological research, aware of the direction of the field and its broad applicability
* Often having to switch between R and Python: very few users are willing to deal with the friction
* Rbanism - automation, reproducibility and scalability in urbanism research with R

:::

## Context

* Idea after SDSL2024: why not build a cross-language infrastructure around `momepy`
* Explored wrapping, porting and low-level implementation approach

## Two proposals

* **`momer`**: extending `momepy` to R users (R wrapper)
* **`mome(rs)`**: cross-language infrastructure for urban morphometrics (low-level implementation in Rust)

---

### `momer`: extending `momepy` to R users (wrapper)

* Why:
  * the potential of `momepy` reaches beyond Python, and its adoption in the broader scientific community and practice could be significantly enhanced by integrating it with R
  * can activate a cross-language morphometrics community in preparation for low-level cross-language infrastructure (see `mome(rs)`)

* What:
  * An R package wrapping `momepy` with `reticulate` in an `sf`-compatible way and with mirrored documentation.
---

### `momer`: extending `momepy` to R users (wrapper)

::: {.incremental}

* [ISC grant](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/callforproposals.html) proposal to be submitted before 1 October
* [Proposal drafted](https://cforgaci.github.io/momer/isc-proposal.pdf) and requesting budget for 1-year max. 0,4FTE funding of RSE time.
* We are seeking feedback and support:
  * Community support: Rbanism &#9989;, r-spatial &#x2753;, geocompr &#x2753;, ISUF &#x2753;, and SDSL &#x2753; communities
  * Feedback on the proposal
  * Feedback from ISC

### `momers` (or simply `mome`): cross-language infrastructure for urban morphometrics

::: {.incremental}

* Why?
  * To enable the broader scientific community and practice to conduct morphological analyses in a scalable way beyond language boundaries.

* What?
  * A Rust crate implementing core urban morphometric functions and algorithms, with bindings for Python and R

### `momers` (or simply `mome`): cross-language infrastructure for urban morphometrics

* [OEC2025](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/calls-for-proposals/open-escience-call-oec-2025/) proposal to be submitted before 13 October
* Proposal work in progress by [Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/), [Claudiu Forgaci](https://urbandesigntudelft.nl/team/claudiu-forgaci/) and [Jiong Wang](https://research.utwente.nl/en/persons/jiong-wang)
* Seeking: community support and international co-applicants, possibly with a scientific case

## Two scientific cases

1. Morphology-based procedural city generation (building on [Post 2024](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:d6dc629c-c75e-4578-b1a1-8ac741133751)) <!-- TODO one sentence description of the scientific challenge for speaker notes -->

2. Global morpho-typology of urban river spaces (building on [Forgaci et al. 2025](https://www.isuf2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/book_of_abstract_15-07-2025.pdf#page=89)) <!-- TODO one sentence description of the scientific challenge for speaker notes -->
