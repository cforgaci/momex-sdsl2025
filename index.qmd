## Background

![](img/background.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}

- academic profile, conducting urban morphological research, aware of the direction of the field and its broad applicability
- developer of R packages... rcoins is an R port and adaptation of the momepy implementation of the COINS alogrithm
- Rbanism community building - automation, reproducibility and scalability in urbanism research with R ... first R... then less strict, Python too... few users are willing to switch language

## What is `momex`?

::: {.incremental}

* Idea after SDSL 2024: why not build a cross-language infrastructure on `momepy`?
* Considered wrapping, porting and low-level implementation approach

* Two proposals:
  1. **`momer`**: extending `momepy` to R users (R wrapper)
  2. **`mome(.rs)`**: cross-language infrastructure for urban morphometrics (low-level implementation in Rust)

### `momer`: extending `momepy` to R users (wrapper)

::: {.incremental}

* Why?
  * The potential of `momepy` reaches beyond Python, and its adoption in the broader scientific community and practice could be significantly enhanced by integrating it with R.
  * It can activate a cross-language morphometrics community in preparation for low-level cross-language infrastructure (see [`mome(.rs)`](#momers))

* What?
  * An R package wrapping `momepy` with `reticulate` in an `sf`-compatible way and with synchronised documentation.

### `mome.rs` (or simply `mome`): cross-language infrastructure for urban morphometrics

::: {.incremental}

* Why?
  * To enable the broader scientific community and practice to conduct morphological analyses in a scalable way.
  * To provide developers a shared low-level code base that is easily maintainable and serves multiple languages.

* What?
  * A Rust crate (or more) implementing core urban morphometric functions and algorithms, building on existing infrastructure (e.g., `GeoRust`, `polars`), with bindings for `momepy`, `momer`<span class="fragment">, `mome.jl`, etc.</span>
